This directory is reserved for custom integration icons.

Currently, this integration uses Material Design Icons (MDI) for all sensor icons, which are built into Home Assistant and don't require additional assets.

For integration branding, users will see the default Home Assistant integration icon until/unless the integration is added to the official Home Assistant brands repository.
