EcoWater HydroLink Services Platform

Implements service calls for the HydroLink integration, providing user-accessible
control functions for EcoWater water softener devices. Enables manual regeneration
triggering and other device management capabilities through Home Assistant services.

Service Capabilities:
- Manual regeneration initiation for immediate salt treatment
- Device control and management functions
- Integration with Home Assistant automation and scripts
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Secure API communication with proper authentication

Available Services:
- trigger_regeneration: Manually start a regeneration cycle
- Future services: Schedule management, maintenance reminders, etc.

This module bridges user actions in Home Assistant with the HydroLink cloud API,
ensuring secure and reliable device control while maintaining proper error handling
and user feedback.
