EcoWater HydroLink Home Assistant Integration

Main module for the Home Assistant integration with EcoWater HydroLink water softeners.
Provides real-time monitoring, control, and alerting capabilities through the HydroLink
cloud service. Handles component setup, config flow, service registration, and data
coordination.

This integration offers comprehensive monitoring of water usage, salt levels, system
performance, regeneration status, and maintenance alerts with real-time WebSocket updates.
