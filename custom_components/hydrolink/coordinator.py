EcoWater HydroLink Data Update Coordinator

Manages data synchronization and updates between the HydroLink cloud API and 
Home Assistant entities. Provides centralized data management with real-time
WebSocket updates, intelligent polling, and comprehensive error handling.

Key Features:
- Centralized data update coordination for all HydroLink entities
- Real-time WebSocket integration for immediate updates
- Intelligent polling with configurable update intervals
- Robust error handling and connection management
- Automatic retry logic for failed API calls
- Data validation and state management
- Integration with Home Assistant's coordinator pattern

This coordinator serves as the bridge between the HydroLink API and all 
sensor entities, ensuring consistent data flow and optimal performance
while minimizing API calls and respecting rate limits.
