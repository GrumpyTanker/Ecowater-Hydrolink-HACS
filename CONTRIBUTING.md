## Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting
- Use [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) for linting
- Add type hints to all functions and methods
- Write docstrings for all public functions, classes, and methods

### Code Quality

Run these commands before submitting:

```bash
# Format code
black custom_components/hydrolink tests

# Lint code
pylint custom_components/hydrolink

# Run tests with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=custom_components/hydrolink --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage (currently 58%)
- Use pytest for testing
- Mock external API calls using pytest fixtures

Example test structure:
```python
import pytest
from custom_components.hydrolink.api import HydroLinkApi

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_api_functionality(mock_api):
    """Test API functionality."""
    # Your test code here
    pass
```

### Commit Messages

- Use clear and meaningful commit messages
- Start with a verb in present tense (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add detailed description if needed

Examples:
```
Add support for new sensor types
Fix WebSocket reconnection logic
Update documentation for configuration options
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Update info.md for HACS-specific information
- Add docstrings to all new functions and classes
- Update version history in relevant files

## Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/GrumpyTanker/Ecowater-Hydrolink-HACS/tags).

## Release Process

1. Update version in `manifest.json`
2. Update version in `__init__.py`
3. Update `README.md` with changes
4. Create a new tag and release on GitHub
5. HACS will automatically pick up the new version
