## [1.2.3] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed
- **Energy Dashboard Support**: Added `device_class: water` to all water volume sensors
  - Sensors now properly appear in Home Assistant's Energy Dashboard water tracking
  - Affected sensors: `gallons_used_today`, `avg_daily_use_gals`, `total_outlet_water_gals`, `treated_water_avail_gals`, `water_counter_gals`
  - Sensors with `state_class: total_increasing` are now compatible with long-term statistics

**Impact**: Medium - Enables water consumption tracking in Energy Dashboard

## [1.2.2] - 2025-10-10

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed multiple sensor scaling issues
  - `capacity_remaining_percent`: Now correctly divides by 10 (was showing 850 instead of 85%)
  - `avg_salt_per_regen_lbs`: Now correctly divides by 1000 (was showing mg instead of lbs)
  - `total_salt_use_lbs`: Now correctly divides by 1000 (was showing mg instead of lbs)
  - Fixed sensors with `_tenths` anywhere in name (not just at end), including `iron_level_tenths_ppm` and `tlc_avg_temp_tenths_c`

### Added
- **NEW SENSORS**: Added 15 additional sensor definitions that were available in API but not exposed:
  - `iron_level_tenths_ppm`: Iron level in parts per million
  - `tlc_avg_temp_tenths_c`: TLC average temperature in Celsius
  - `salt_effic_grains_per_lb`: Salt efficiency metric
  - `salt_type_enum`: Salt type indicator
  - `water_counter_gals`: Water counter in gallons
  - `error_code`: Numeric error code
  - `service_active`: Service mode status
  - `time_lost_events`: Power outage/time lost event counter
  - `product_serial_number`: Device serial number
  - `location`: Device location
  - `system_type`: System type identifier
  - `model_display_code`: Model display code
  - `base_software_version`: Base software version
  - `esp_software_part_number`: ESP software part number
  - `regen_time_secs`: Regeneration time in seconds
- Comprehensive test coverage for all scaling conversions

### Changed
- Enhanced `HydroLinkSensor.native_value` to handle three conversion types:
  1. Tenths conversion (÷10) for any property with `_tenths` in name
  2. Capacity conversion (÷10) for `capacity_remaining_percent`
  3. Salt conversion (÷1000) for salt mass values
- Removed duplicate sensor definitions that were causing conflicts

### Documentation
- Updated SENSORS.md with comprehensive conversion documentation
- Added tables showing all affected variables and their conversions
- Documented new sensors with units, device classes, and descriptions

**Impact**: High - Critical fix for incorrect sensor readings, enables access to all API data

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-10

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Salt level sensor now displays correct percentage values
  - Fixed sensors with `_tenths` suffix displaying 10x too high
  - Salt level now correctly shows 75% instead of 750%
  - Affects: `salt_level_tenths` and any other percentage values from API
- Added automatic value conversion for all sensors ending in `_tenths`
- Implemented proper handling of tenths-based API values

### Changed
- Enhanced `HydroLinkSensor.native_value` property with automatic conversion logic
- Updated sensor documentation to explain API value conversions

### Documentation
- Added "API Value Conversions" section to SENSORS.md
- Documented raw API format vs displayed values
- Explained which sensors receive automatic conversion

**Impact**: High - Critical fix for users with incorrect sensor readings
